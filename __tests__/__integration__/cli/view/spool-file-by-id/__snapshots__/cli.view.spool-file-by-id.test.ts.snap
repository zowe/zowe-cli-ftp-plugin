"================z/OS FTP VIEW SPOOL-FILE-BY-ID HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   spool-file-by-id | sfbi

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   View the contents of a spool file from a z/OS job on spool/JES queues. The
   command does not pre-validate the JOBID or spool ID.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp view spool-file-by-id <jobid> <spoolfileid> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   jobid		 (string)

      The z/OS JOBID of the job containing the spool file you want to view. No
      pre-validation of the JOBID is performed.

   spoolfileid		 (number)

      The spool file ID number for the spool file to view. No pre-validation of the ID
      is performed.

 FTP CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ----------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

   --secure-ftp (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

   --connection-timeout | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

      you are connecting securely
