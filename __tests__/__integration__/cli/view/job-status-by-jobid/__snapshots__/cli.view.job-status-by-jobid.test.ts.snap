"================z/OS FTP VIEW JOB-STATUS-BY-JOBID HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   job-status-by-jobid | jsbj

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   View status details of a single z/OS job on spool/JES queues. The command does
   not prevalidate the JOBID.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp view job-status-by-jobid <jobid> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   jobid		 (string)

      The ID of the jobfor which you would like to list spool files

 FTP CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ----------------------

   --host | -H (string)
