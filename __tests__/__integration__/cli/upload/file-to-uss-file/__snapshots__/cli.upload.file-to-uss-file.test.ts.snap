 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

 -----------

   Upload contents of a local to a Unix System Services file.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp upload file-to-uss-file <file> <ussFile> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   file		 (local file path)

      Upload the contents of this local file to a data set.

   ussFile		 (string)

      The USS file to which you would like to upload content.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary | -b (boolean)

      Upload content in binary mode.

 FTP CONNECTION OPTIONS

      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
