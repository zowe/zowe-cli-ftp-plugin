"================z/OS FTP UPLOAD STDIN-TO-DATA-SET HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   stdin-to-data-set | stds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload contents piped to stdin to a z/OS data set

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp upload stdin-to-data-set <dataSet> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSet		 (string)

      The data set (PDS member or physical sequential data set) to which you would
      like to upload content.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary | -b (boolean)

      Upload content in binary mode.

   --encoding | --ec (string)

      The encoding for download and upload of z/OS data set.

 FTP CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ----------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

   --secure-ftp (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
