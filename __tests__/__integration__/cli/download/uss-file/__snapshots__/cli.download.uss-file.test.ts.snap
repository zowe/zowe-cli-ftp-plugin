"================z/OS VIEW DOWNLOAD USS-FILE HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   uss-file | uss | uf

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Download the contents of a USS file to a local file

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp download uss-file <ussFile> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   ussFile		 (string)

      The path to the USS file you would like to download.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary | -b (boolean)

      Download the file content in binary mode, which means that no data conversion is
      performed. The data transfer process returns each line as-is, without
      translation. No delimiters are added between records.

   --file | -f (string)

      The path to the local file where you want to download the content. When you omit
      the option, the command generates a file name automatically for you.

 FTP CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ----------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

   --secure-ftp (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

   --connection-timeout | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

 TLS / SECURE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -------------------------------

   --reject-unauthorized | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates. Only specify this if you are connecting to a
      secure FTP instance.

   --server-name | --sn (string)

      Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. Only specify if
      you are connecting securely

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zftp-profile | --zftp-p (string)

      The name of a (zftp) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

   --cert-key-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --show-inputs-only (boolean)

      Show command inputs and do not run the command

   --response-format-json | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

   --help-examples (boolean)

      Display examples for all the commands in a group

   --help-web | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser
