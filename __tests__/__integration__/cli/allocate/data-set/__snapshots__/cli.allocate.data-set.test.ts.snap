"================z/OS VIEW DELETE DATA-SET HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Allocate a sequential dataset or partitioned dataset with '--dcb \\"PDSTYPE=PDS\\"'

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp allocate data-set <datasetName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   datasetName		 (string)

      The dataset name you'd like to allocate.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --dcb (string)

      DCB parameters for dataset allocation. It's space separated like \\"RECFM=FB
      LRECL=326 BLKSIZE=23472\\". For the list of possible DCB parameters, visit
      https://github.com/IBM/zos-node-accessor/tree/1.0.x#allocate.

 FTP CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ----------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

   --secure-ftp (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

   --connection-timeout | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

 TLS / SECURE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -------------------------------

   --reject-unauthorized | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates. Only specify this if you are connecting to a
      secure FTP instance.

   --server-name | --sn (string)

      Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. Only specify if
      you are connecting securely

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zftp-profile | --zftp-p (string)

      The name of a (zftp) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

      Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For
      more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.

   --cert-key-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --show-inputs-only (boolean)

      Show command inputs and do not run the command

   --response-format-json | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

   --help-web | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser

      $ zowe zos-ftp allocate data-set \\"IBMUSER.DATASET\\"

   - Allocate a partitioned dataset \\"IBMUSER.DATASET\\":
