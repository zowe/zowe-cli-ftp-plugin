 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Submit a job from a cataloged data set containing JCL. The JCL will be
   downloaded via FTP and then submitted.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp submit data-set <dataSet> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSet		 (string)

      The data set containing JCL that you would like to submit

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --wait  | -w (string)

      Specify job query interval and max times of querying job status. The format of
      this option is comma-separated numeric values. For example, '5,12' means queries
      job status every 5 seconds for 12 times at most.

   --wait-for-output  | --wfo (boolean)

      Wait for the job to enter OUTPUT status before completing the command.

   --wait-for-active  | --wfa (boolean)

      Wait for the job to enter ACTIVE status before completing the command.

   --secure-ftp  (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

   --connection-timeout  | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

 REQUIRED OPTIONS
 ----------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user  | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password  | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

 TLS / SECURE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -------------------------------

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates. Only specify this if you are connecting to a
      secure FTP instance.

   --server-name  | --sn (string)

      Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. Only specify if
      you are connecting securely

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zftp-profile  | --zftp-p (string)

      The name of a (zftp) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile  | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type  | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value  | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

   --help-examples  (boolean)

      Display examples for all the commands in a the group

   --help-web  | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Submit a job residing in the data set
   \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\":

      $ zowe zos-ftp submit data-set \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\"

   - Submit a job from the data set \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\" and
   print only the job ID:

      $ zowe zos-ftp submit data-set \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\" --rff jobid --rft string

   - Submit a job from the data set \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\" and
   wait for job complete.:

      $ zowe zos-ftp submit data-set \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\" --wait 5,12
