"================z/OS FTP VIEW USS-FILE HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   uss-file | uss

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   View the contents of a Unix System Services File

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp view uss-file <ussFile> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   ussFile		 (string)

      The USS file you'd like to view the contents of.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      View content in binary form without converting to ASCII text

   --secure-ftp  (string)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

   --connection-timeout  | --ct (number)

      Default value: 10000

      Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. Only specify if
      you are connecting securely
