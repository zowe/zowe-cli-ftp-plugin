"================z/OS VIEW LIST DATA-SET HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   View the contents of a z/OS data set

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp view data-set <dataSet> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSet		 (string)

      The data set (PDS member or physical sequential data set) which you would like
      to view the contents of.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      View content in binary form without converting to ASCII text

   --secure-ftp  (string)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

   --connection-timeout  | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

 REQUIRED OPTIONS
 ----------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user  | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

 TLS / SECURE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -------------------------------

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates. Only specify this if you are connecting to a
      secure FTP instance.

   --server-name  | --sn (string)

      Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. Only specify if
      you are connecting securely

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zftp-profile  | --zftp-p (string)

      The name of a (zftp) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text
