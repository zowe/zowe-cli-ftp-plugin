"================z/OS FTP UPLOAD STDIN-TO-USS-FILE HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   stdin-to-uss-file | stuf | stu

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload from stdin to a Unix System Services File

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp upload stdin-to-uss-file <ussFile> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   ussFile		 (string)

      The USS file to which you would like to upload content.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

   --secure-ftp  (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000
