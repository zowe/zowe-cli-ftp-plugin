"================z/OS FTP UPLOAD FILE-TO-USS-FILE HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   file-to-uss-file | ftuf | ftu

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload contents of a local to a Unix System Services file.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp upload file-to-uss-file <file> <ussFile> [options]

 --------------------

   file		 (local file path)

      Upload the contents of this local file to a data set.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      Upload content in binary mode.

   --secure-ftp  (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.
