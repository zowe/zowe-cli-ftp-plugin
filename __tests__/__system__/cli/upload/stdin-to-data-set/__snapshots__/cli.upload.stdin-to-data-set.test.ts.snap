"================z/OS FTP UPLOAD STDIN-TO-DATA-SET HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   stdin-to-data-set | stds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload contents piped to stdin to a z/OS data set

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp upload stdin-to-data-set <dataSet> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSet		 (string)

      The data set (PDS member or physical sequential data set) to which you would
      like to upload content.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      Upload content in binary mode.

   --secure-ftp  (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

   --connection-timeout  | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

 ----------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

      Default value: 21

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password  | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

 TLS / SECURE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -------------------------------

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates. Only specify this if you are connecting to a
      secure FTP instance.

   --server-name  | --sn (string)

      Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. Only specify if
      you are connecting securely

 PROFILE OPTIONS

   --zftp-profile  | --zftp-p (string)

      The name of a (zftp) profile to load for this command execution.

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type  | --tt (string)
