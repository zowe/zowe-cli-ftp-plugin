"================z/OS FTP UPLOAD FILE-TO-DATA-SET ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   file-to-data-set | ftds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload contents of a local file to a z/OS data set

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp upload file-to-data-set <file> <dataSet> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   file		 (local file path)

      Upload the contents of this file to the data set

   dataSet		 (string)

      The data set (PDS member or physical sequential data set) to which you would
      like to upload content.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary | -b (boolean)

      Upload content in binary mode.

   --dcb (string)

      DCB parameters for dataset allocation if not existing. It's space separated like
      RECFM=FB LRECL=326 BLKSIZE=23472

   --host | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.
