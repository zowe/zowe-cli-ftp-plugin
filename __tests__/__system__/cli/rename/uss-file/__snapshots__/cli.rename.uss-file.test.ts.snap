"================z/OS FTP RENAME USS-FILE HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   uss-file | uss | uf

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Rename a USS file or directory

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp rename uss-file <olduss> <newuss> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   olduss		 (string)

      The current name of the USS file you want to rename.

   newuss		 (string)

      The new name for the USS file.

 FTP CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ----------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --secure-ftp (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
