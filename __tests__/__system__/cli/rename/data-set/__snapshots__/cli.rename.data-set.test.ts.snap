"================z/OS FTP RENAME DATA-SET HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Rename a cataloged data set

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp rename data-set <oldDataSet> <newDataSet> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   oldDataSet		 (string)

      The current name of the data set you want to rename.

   newDataSet		 (string)

      The new name for the data set.

 REQUIRED OPTIONS
 ----------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user  | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password  | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --secure-ftp  (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

      Default value: true

   --connection-timeout  | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

 TLS / SECURE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -------------------------------

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates. Only specify this if you are connecting to a
      secure FTP instance.

   --server-name  | --sn (string)

      Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. Only specify if
      you are connecting securely

   --zftp-profile  | --zftp-p (string)

   - Rename the data set member \\"ibmuser.cntl(alloc)\\" to
