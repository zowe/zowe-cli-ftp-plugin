"================z/OS FTP LIST USS-FILES HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   uss-files | uss

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   List USS files and subdirectories in a directory.
   The following values can be used with the --response-format-filter (--rff)
   argument todisplay more data from the data sets:name, size, owner, group, and
   permissions

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp list uss-files <directory> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   directory		 (string)

      The USS directory to list files in

 REQUIRED OPTIONS
 ----------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user  | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password  | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --secure-ftp  (string)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.

   --connection-timeout  | --ct (number)

      How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established.

      Default value: 10000

 TLS / SECURE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -------------------------------

      Reject self-signed certificates. Only specify this if you are connecting to a
      secure FTP instance.

   --server-name  | --sn (string)

      you are connecting securely

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zftp-profile  | --zftp-p (string)

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

      $ zowe zos-ftp list uss-files \\"/u/users/ibmuser\\"

   - List USS files in the directory \\"/u/users/ibmuser/\\" and

      $ zowe zos-ftp list uss-files \\"/u/users/ibmuser/\\" --rff name
