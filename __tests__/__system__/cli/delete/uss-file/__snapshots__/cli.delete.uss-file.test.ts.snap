"================z/OS FTP DELETE USS-FILE HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   uss-file | uss

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Delete a USS file

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-ftp delete uss-file <ussFile> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   ussFile		 (string)

      The absolute path to a USS file you would like to delete.

 REQUIRED OPTIONS
 ----------------

   --for-sure  | -f (boolean)

      Specify this option to confirm that you want to delete the data set permanently.

   --host  | -H (string)

      The hostname or IP address of the z/OS server to connect to.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The port of the z/OS FTP server.

      Default value: 21

   --user  | -u (string)

      Username for authentication on z/OS

   --password  | -p | --pass | --pw (string)

      Password to authenticate to FTP.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --recursive  (boolean)

      Delete the directory and all files/directories under it.

   --secure-ftp  (boolean)

      Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for
      control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted
      control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses
      port 990). Note: Unfortunately, this plugin's functionality only works with FTP
      and FTPS, not 'SFTP' which is FTP over SSH.
